This project is a full-stack web application for managing lab demo signups and scheduling.
It is organized into two main parts:

📁 Project Structure
client/ — Front-End

Contains all UI and client-side logic.

index.html — main entry page

lab3.js / framework files — front-end JavaScript

img/ — front-end images and assets

Additional framework code for the enhanced version of the project

All front-end assets should remain inside the client folder.

server/ — Back-End

Contains all server-side logic and REST API endpoints.

server.js — main server file (REST API implementation)

data/ — server assets (ignored by Git; copy manually on deployment)

client/


This includes pages, components, static assets, and JS logic.
